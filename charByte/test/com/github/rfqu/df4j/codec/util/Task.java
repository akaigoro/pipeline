/**
 * Base class for dataflow nodes (including Actors).
 * Features:
 *  - Task is Runnable - can be submitted to an Executor
 *  - Task holds default executor, which was set at the moment of creation:
 *  either explicitly, or implicitly via thread-local current executor.
 *  If executor is null, firing executes immediately on the thread which fires the task.
 *  - Task is Link, and can be enqueued in the standard {link:DoublyLinkedQueue},
 *   e.g can be sent to ActorLQ.
